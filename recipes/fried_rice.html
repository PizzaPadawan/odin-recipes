        <title>Mushroom Fried Rice</title>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>As someone who tries to eat plant-based foods as often as possible (with the exception of sushi) I LOVE mushrooms. They're a great alternative to meat.</p>
        <p>There's a restaurant in my small hometown of Warroad, MN called Daisy Garden. They have the best fried rice I've ever eaten in my entire life.</p>
        <p>This recipe is about 80% as good as that. (You'll never make the real thing at home. Khan Duong is a culinary master.)</p>
        <p>It calls for a variety of mushrooms, but if you're in a place without a good food co-op like me, just baby bellas and shiitakes still taste pretty darn good.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice (preferably refrigerated overnight)</li>
            <li>1/4 pound oyster mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 pound smeiji mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 pound crimini mushrooms, chopped and diced (use 3/4 pound if you can't find oysters / smeijis)</li>
            <li>1 fresh shiitake mushroom cap, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>3 green onions, chopped (green and white sections separated)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral cooking oil of your choice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>0.5 tbsp sesame oil drizzle</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat cooking oil in a wok over medium-high heat. When properly heated, add garlic and white part of green onion. 
                Stir until fragrant (about 1 minute.) Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook until blistered / mostly cooked, about 5 -6 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the rice. Stir and break apart to separate the grains as much as possible, combining evenly with the mushrooms. Cook until rice is fully heated and starting to lightly toast.
                Add soy sauce and green part of green onions. Stir for another minute to mix evenly.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat, drizzle with sesame oil, and ENJOY!</li>    
        </ol>
