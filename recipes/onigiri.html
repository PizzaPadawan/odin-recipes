    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Onigiri is a delicious Japanese dish made from rice, formed into a triangular ball. It is either filled in the middle one of many assorted fillings, or additional ingredients are mixed in with the rice.</p>
    <p>A small strip of nori (seaweed paper} is usually wrapped around the bottom to make it easier to hold while eating. Think of it as the Japanese version of a sandwich!</p>
    <p>In this recipe, we'll be making Okaka Onigiri, where the rice is mixed with a umami combination of bonito flake, tsuyu sauce, and sesame seeds.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>4 cups ice water (set aside in a bowl)</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt (set aside in a bowl)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp katsuobushi (bonito flake)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tsuyu sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori, cut into 1/2 inch strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparing rice mixture:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your rice twice using a fine mesh strainer and a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add your 2 cups washed rice and 2 cups water to your rice cooker and set to Cook.</li>
        <li>Once your rice cooker has flipped to the Keep Warm setting, add 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 tbsp salt to a small saucepan and heat on medium-high, stirring until combined.</li>
        <li>Remove your sushi rice seasoning from the heat and set aside</li>
        <li>In a bowl, stir to combine your bonito flake, tsuyu sauce, and sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>After your rice has rested on the Keep Warm setting for 10 minutes, transfer the rice to a large wooden bowl (or a hangiri, if you have one) and drizzle your sushi rice seasoning over the rice. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add bonito flake mixture to the rice and stir to combine. Cover sushi rice bowl with a damp cloth and wait 15 - 20 minutes, or until rice has cooled to room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Forming onigiri balls:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once rice has cooled, line up the water bowl, salt, rice mixture, and nori sheeets.</li>
        <li>To form onigiri, first wet your hands in the ice water, then take a pinch of salt and rub it on your hands.</li>
        <li>Pick up a large handful of rice and form it into a triangular ball.</li>
        <li>Once the ball is formed, wrap a nori sheet around the bottom of the onigiri.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all rice is used, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
