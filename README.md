# odin-recipes
A real Odin Project project about recipes.
This project is a test of my knowledge so far. It might be a bit rough.
I haven't been super consistent with lessons, so I'll probably have to look up a bunch of stuff.
But I'm gonna do it, dammit. I'll check back here when I'm done and talk about how it went and what I've learned.
