<h3>Description</h3>
<p>These burritos have become a go-to recipe for me lately, as they're incredibly easy to make and they freeze well.</p>
<p>Whether you need something consistent to pack for lunch, or something on hand to heat up when you're in a hurry, these crockpot burritos are the perfect solution!</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup uncooked brown or white rice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup whole kernel corn</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of your favorite salsa (I like using salsa verde)</li>
    <li>28oz diced tomatoes, drained</li>
    <li>28oz canned black beans, drained</li>
    <li>2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>10 burrito-style tortillas</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In your slow cooker, add rice, broth, corn, salsa, tomatoes, beans, peppers, and seasonings. Stir and cover.</li>
    <li>Cook on low 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. Be sure to stir halfway through cooking so the rice doesn't stick.</li>
    <li>Lay out your tortillas and place 1/3 to 1/2 cup on each tortilla. You can also add cheese if you'd like. Use your preffered burrito rolling technique.</li>
    <li>If freezing, simply wrap in plastic wrap and throw them in the freezer. Transfer to the fridge to thaw overnight before cooking if you want the easiest microwave experience.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
